# Deno TUI

As a practice to get used to the [deno runtime](https://deno.com), this is a testing repository to create a simple TUI project.
Not sure what I'll make, either a API tester like postman or [yaak](https://yaak.app) (which I really really recommend), a system usage monitor, or an ENV manager thing.
